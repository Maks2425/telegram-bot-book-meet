# Telegram Bot Development Rules

## Code Quality Standards

- **Clean Code Principles**: Always write clean, maintainable code. Identify and suggest improvements and refactoring opportunities proactively.
- **Expert-Level Code**: Write code at an expert level with proper architecture, design patterns, and best practices.
- **Code Analysis**: Before writing any code, analyze the problem carefully, think through the solution, and suggest the best approach before implementation.

## Python Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Use context managers for resource management
- Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility principle)
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
- Use async/await properly for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper logging instead of print statements
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Structure code with proper separation of concerns

## Security Best Practices

- **Critical**: Carefully analyze all code for security vulnerabilities, especially regarding API keys, tokens, and sensitive data
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets in source code
- Always use environment variables or secure configuration management for sensitive credentials
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure methods for storing and accessing credentials
- Warn about potential security risks before implementing code that handles sensitive data
- Check for accidental exposure of credentials in logs, error messages, or responses
- Use `.env` files with `.gitignore` protection for local development
- Implement proper authentication and authorization where needed

## Code Review and Suggestions

- Proactively suggest refactoring opportunities
- Point out code smells and anti-patterns
- Suggest performance improvements where applicable
- Recommend better algorithms or data structures when appropriate
- Identify potential bugs or edge cases
- Suggest test coverage for critical functionality

## Telegram Bot Specific

- Handle Telegram API rate limits properly
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use webhooks or polling appropriately
- Structure bot commands and handlers clearly
- Implement proper state management for conversations
- Handle user input validation
- Use proper logging for debugging and monitoring
